## Requirements

1. Node and npm
2. Mongodb

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and move to it
2. Install npm modules: `npm install`
3. Install bower dependencies `bower install`
4. Start mongodb with `mongod` (default port 27107, to change that modify the config file)
5. Start up the server: `node server`
6. In another terminal/console start gulp `gulp`
7. Head to browser at http://localhost:9000
